# Hey, I'm Jack

I'm a 22 year old developer based in Dallas, Texas. I'm also currently looking for work! Would love to chat sometime.

## Intro

I **just might** be an introverted web developer with a passion for creating accessible, performant, and whimsical web applications.

My journey in web development is marked by a continuous exploration of new technologies and a commitment to building user-friendly digital experiences.

### My Latest Endeavors

**@qwikdev/astro**: Enhancing Astro with the power of resumability and zero hydration for building content-rich websites and robust web applications.

**Qwik UI**: An open-source, accessible, and headless library designed for crafting complex web apps with ease.

**Ra Media**: A unique video production studio website built with Astro JS and Qwik, soon to feature Astro view transitions.

### Courses I've taken

I'm also a self-confessed coursaholic, constantly learning from courses like "CSS For JS Devs", "The Joy of React", and "MySQL for developers", among others.

Currently, I'm diving into "Total TypeScript" and "Practical Accessibility" to sharpen my skills further.

### UI Frenzy

- **The Popover API**: Early adoption of MDN's native popover API in Qwik, complete with animation support.
- **The Combobox**: Innovating autocomplete components, portals, and listbox behavior.
- **The Accordion**: Developing an accordion component that enhances content accessibility and interaction.
